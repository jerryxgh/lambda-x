;;; Code:
(use-package minuet
    :bind
    (("M-y" . #'minuet-complete-with-minibuffer) ;; use minibuffer for completion
     ("M-i" . #'minuet-show-suggestion) ;; use overlay for completion
     ("C-c m" . #'minuet-configure-provider)
     :map minuet-active-mode-map
     ;; These keymaps activate only when a minuet suggestion is displayed in the current buffer
     ("M-p" . #'minuet-previous-suggestion) ;; invoke completion or cycle to next completion
     ("M-n" . #'minuet-next-suggestion) ;; invoke completion or cycle to previous completion
     ("M-A" . #'minuet-accept-suggestion) ;; accept whole completion
     ;; Accept the first line of completion, or N lines with a numeric-prefix:
     ;; e.g. C-u 2 M-a will accepts 2 lines of completion.
     ("M-a" . #'minuet-accept-suggestion-line)
     ("M-e" . #'minuet-dismiss-suggestion))

    :init
    ;; if you want to enable auto suggestion.
    ;; Note that you can manually invoke completions without enable minuet-auto-suggestion-mode
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'minuet-auto-suggestion-mode)

    :config
    ;; You can use M-x minuet-configure-provider to interactively configure provider and model
    (setq minuet-provider 'openai-fim-compatible)

    (minuet-set-optional-options minuet-openai-fim-compatible-options :max_tokens 64))

    ;; For Evil users: When defining `minuet-ative-mode-map` in insert
    ;; or normal states, the following one-liner is required.

    ;; (add-hook 'minuet-active-mode-hook #'evil-normalize-keymaps)

    ;; This is *not* necessary when defining `minuet-active-mode-map`.

    ;; To minimize frequent overhead, it is recommended to avoid adding
    ;; `evil-normalize-keymaps` to `minuet-active-mode-hook`. Instead,
    ;; bind keybindings directly within `minuet-active-mode-map` using
    ;; standard Emacs key sequences, such as `M-xxx`. This approach should
    ;; not conflict with Evil's keybindings, as Evil primarily avoids
    ;; using `M-xxx` bindings.
